            </h1>

                    width="100px">
            </h1>
            <p>Adidas AG (German: [adiˌdas] (listen))[4] is a German multinational corporation, founded and
                headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, that designs and manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories.
                It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after
                Nike.[5][6] It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which consists 8.33% stake of the football
                club Bayern München,[7] and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas's revenue for 2018
                was listed at €21.915 billion.[3]

                The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house; he was joined by his elder brother
                Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler
                assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance
                the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to
                utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at
                the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf
                created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival.[1]

                The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe
                designs as a marketing aid. The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu
                Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey,[8][9] became so successful that Dassler
                described Adidas as "The three stripes company"</p>

            <h1>New Balance <br>
                <img src="/imgs/newbalancelogo.png" width="150px">

            </h1>
            <p>New Balance Athletics, Inc. (NB), best known as simply New Balance, is one of the world's major sports
                footwear and apparel manufacturers. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the multinational corporation was
                founded in 1906 as the New Balance Arch Support Company.

                New Balance maintains a manufacturing presence in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom
                for the European market, where it produces some of its popular models. New Balance claims to
                differentiate its products with technical features, such as blended gel inserts, heel counters and a
                greater selection of sizes, particularly for very narrow or very wide widths. The company is privately
                held and totaled $4.4 billion in revenue in 2021.[2]
                New Balance manufactures a range of shoes and apparel. It maintains a manufacturing presence in the
                United States, as well as in the United Kingdom for the European market, where it produces some of its
                most popular models such as the 990—in contrast to its competitors, which often manufacture exclusively
                outside the United States and Europe.[32][33] As a result, New Balance shoes tend to be more expensive
                than those of many other manufacturers. To offset this pricing difference, New Balance claims to
                differentiate its products with technical features, such as blended gel inserts, heel counters and a
                greater selection of sizes, particularly for very narrow or very wide widths.[34] Between 1992 and 2019,
                the company made approximately $69 billion in profit.[34] In 2017, New Balance's facility in Flimby,
                England was producing 28,000 pairs of shoes a week, 5 percent of the New Balance shoes sold in the
                European market.</p>
