            <h1>Distribution</h1>
            <p>As a sneaker lover, you may be curious as to how the products you know and love are created. How are sneakers manufactured, how does the process work, and where does it all happen? While every sneaker brand has its own manufacturing and distribution process, there are a few commonly seen methods used across several popular sneaker brands. Below, let’s review some of the most popular distribution channels and retail strategies utilized by all of your favorite brands.
                Distribution is the process by which a brand makes their product or service available to the consumer or business that needs it. A distribution channel is the vehicle in which that product or service is delivered. Traditionally, there are two types of distribution channels- direct and indirect. These channels can include wholesalers, retailers, distributors, and places throughout the internet.
                Direct distribution channels come into play when a company sells goods or services directly to the customer. For example, direct distribution is one of the distribution channels Nike utilizes by selling their products directly to consumers via their website, mobile app or retail stores.

                This type of distribution channel is managed and organized by the company itself, therefore the brand is responsible for all aspects of delivery and ensuring the customers receive their orders successfully. On one hand, this can be very capital intensive as companies often need a warehouse, logistics system, delivery staff, and much more. However, this allows the company to have full control over their distribution channel and it is easier to cut out inefficiencies.
